/*

Weâ€™re given a table of product purchases. Each row in the table represents an individual user product purchase.

Write a query to get the number of customers that were upsold by purchasing additional products.

Note: If the customer purchased two things on the same day that does not count as an upsell as they were purchased within a similar timeframe.
